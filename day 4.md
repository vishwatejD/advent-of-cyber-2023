# Day 4
## Task name
Baby, it's CeWLd outside 
### Learnings
CEWL- CeWL (pronounced "cool") is a custom word list generator tool that spiders websites to create word lists based on the site's content. Spidering, in the context of web security and penetration testing, refers to the process of automatically navigating and cataloguing a website's content, often to retrieve the site structure, content, and other relevant details. This capability makes CeWL especially valuable to penetration testers aiming to brute-force login pages or uncover hidden directories using organisation-specific terminology.

 Required prerequisite knowledge:-
 
 1.   Specify spidering depth: The -d option allows you to set how deep CeWL should spider. For example, to spider two links deep:` cewl http://10.10.138.243 -d 2 -w output1.txt
  `
 2.   Set minimum and maximum word length: Use the -m and -x options respectively. For instance, to get words between 5 and 10 characters: `cewl http://10.10.138.243 -m 5 -x 10 -w output2.txt`
3.    Handle authentication: If the target site is behind a login, you can use the `-a` flag for form-based authentication.
4.    Custom extensions: The --with-numbers option will append numbers to words, and using `--extension` allows you to append custom extensions to each word, making it useful for directory or file brute-forcing.
5.    Follow external links: By default, CeWL doesn't spider external sites, but using the `--offsite` option allows you to do so.


First we use the AntarctiCrafts homepage to generate a wordlist that could potentially hold the key to the portal. 

we thus use the command `$ cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w pswd.txt http://10.10.138.243 --with-numbers`

This spiders two links deep and lists words with minimum 5 letters. The --with-numbers option will append numbers to words.

Now we must make another file for the usernames.

Thus we use the following command `$ cewl -d 0 -m 5 -w usrnms.txt http://10.10.138.243/team.php --lowercase`

These files must be tried in the login.php site so we can find the correct pair, This can be done by a command tool called Wfuzz.

The command we use is `$ wfuzz -c -z file,usrnms.txt -z file,pswd.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://10.10.138.243/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"`


   1. -z file,usrnms.txt loads the usernames list.
   2. -z file,pswd.txt uses the password list generated by CeWL.
   
  3. --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" hides responses containing the string "Please enter the correct credentials", which is the message displayed for wrong login attempts.
  
   4.  -u specifies the target URL.

  5. -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" provides the POST data format where FUZZ will be replaced by usernames and FUZ2Z by passwords.

We get the output as

Now we enter these credentials and retrieve the flag
